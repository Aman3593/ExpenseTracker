# ExpenseTracker
JAVA program to build an expense tracker where users can:

1. Add income and expenses

2. Categorize their transactions (e.g., Food, Rent, Travel)

3. View monthly summaries

4. Save/load data from a file

Instructions : 

1. When we run your program It should take income/expense as an input

2. Once we choose income/expense it should ask for the sub category like salary/business for income or food/rent/travel for expense

3. Once we enter all the details you should store it somewhere and provide us a monthly summary

4. Also your Java program should take a file as an input where the file may contain multiple income/expense categories entries (you can define the structure of the entries and file)
